# Bitcoin Arbitrage

## Introduction
Daily trading volume in currency exchange markets often exceeds $1 trillion. With the advent of new crypto-currencies, your knowledge of algorithms, and a good pair of sound-canceling headphones, you're convinced that there could be some profitable arbitrage opportunities to exploit.

Sometimes, these currency pairs drift in a way that creates arbitrage loops where you can convert through a certain sequence of currencies to return a profit in your base currency. This is referred to as an arbitrage loop. For example, you could do the following trades with $100 US and the exchange data below:

| Tables        | Are           | Cool          | Tables        | Are           | Cool          |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------------:| ------------- |:-------------:| -------------:|
|               |               |               | **TO**        |               |               |
|               |               | USD           | EUR           | JPY           | BTC           |
|               | USD           | -             |               | 102.4590      | 0.0083        |
| **FROM**      | EUR           | 1.2851        | 0.7779        | 131.7110      |0.01125        |
|               | JPY           | 0.0098        | -             | -             |0.0000811      |
|               | BTC           | 115.65        | 88.8499       | 12325.44      | -             |


* Trade $100 to €77.79
* Trade €77.79 to .8751375 BTC
* Trade .8751375 BTC for $101.20965.

In this puzzle you'll be working in a market where prices are independent of supply and demand. Also, the currency exchange broker is a close friend of ours, so all trading costs are waived.

Your job is to write a program that efficiently finds the best arbitrage opportunities.


## Data Source
To access real-time exchange rates, use our API:
```
http://fx.priceonomics.com/v1/rates/
```
Output will look like the JSON below, where `USD_JPY` is the quantity of JPY that you can purchase for 1 USD.
```json
{
    USD_JPY: "95.7422091",
    USD_USD: "1.0000000",
    JPY_EUR: "0.0080872",
    BTC_USD: "105.5641218",
    ...
}
```
These are not real actual market prices; we've set them algorithmically. They change every second and contain both a periodic and noise component to them. You only have to pull the data once per run of your algorithm.

## Task
Given these exchange rates and the promise of riches, write a program (in any language of your choice) that discovers arbitrage opportunities. You can use any technique you'd like, but we like solutions that would scale with larger sets of currencies.


## Submitting
Email your program, as well as a sample run where it makes a profit, to brendan@priceonomics.com.

In addition, please share a little about your background and interests, the position you're interested in, and what excites you about Priceonomics in your message.
