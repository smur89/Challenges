The decimal zip of two non-negative integers A and B is an integer C whose decimal representation is created from the decimal 
representations of A and B as follows:

-  the first (i.e. the most significant) digit of C is the first digit of A;
-  the second digit of C is the first digit of B;
- the third digit of C is the second digit of A;
- the fourth digit of C is the second digit of B;
- etc.

If one of the integers A and B runs out of digits, the remaining digits of the other integer are appended to the result. The decimal 
representation of 0 is assumed to be "0".

For example, the decimal zip of 12 and 56 is 1526. The decimal zip of 56 and 12 is 5162. The decimal zip of 12345 and 678 is 
16273845. The decimal zip of 123 and 67890 is 16273890. The decimal zip of 1234 and 0 is 10234.

Write a function:

  object Solution { def solution(a: Int, b: Int): Int

that, given two non-negative integers A and B, returns their decimal zip. The function should return -1 if the result exceeds 
100,000,000.

For example, given A = 12345 and B = 678 the function should return 16273845, as explained above. 

Assume that:

  â€¢ A and B are integers within the range [0..100,000,000J.

In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
